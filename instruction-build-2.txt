You have to prove you understood the architecture guide.

You are asked to write a small program which sum an array of integers.

    * r0 will be initialized to a random memory address
    * r1 will be initialized to a random number

If r6 contains the sum of the r1 elements of the array starting at the address
contained in r0, you'll receive a present.

You have to submit your binary to the URL specified in the maze.
curl can be a useful friend, ex:
    curl -X POST --data-binary @cpu-build-2.bin http://__URL__/cpu-build-2


   r0 = start pos
   r1 = random number
   r2 = 0
loop:
   r4 = *(r0)
   r5 = 1
   r0 += r5
   r2 += r4 number donc r4

   r3 = 0
   CMP r1, r3
   JUMP EQ end
   JUMP NEQ loop


end
r6 = r2
